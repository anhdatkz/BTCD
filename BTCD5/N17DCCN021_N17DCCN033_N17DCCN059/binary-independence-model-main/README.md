# binary-independence-model
a notebook and python code aimed at demonstrating information retrieval using binary independence model
## example usage
implementing this code is as easy as importing the BIMModel class, then search the query, with the limit of documents you want to retrieve. The search_query function takes 2 parameters, the query to be searched and the number/limit of results you want to retrieve. The steps are as follows:

- from model import BIMModel

- bim_model = BIMModel()
- results = bim_model.search_query("secondary emission of electrons by positive ion bombardment of the cathode", 10)
- print(results)

## Dataset and notebook
